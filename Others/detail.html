      <p>The world is facing many critical problems. The first issue is poverty which makes it hard to access loans. According to Mrinal Singh, poverty is related to all other issues that the world faces today. Unemployment is the second cause of poverty and poor education is the fifth. 
  
          We all face the effects of poverty in our community
          
          Since poverty affects everyone, Rwandan society is affected too. As a constant girl, I must have a positive impact on society. The best approach to reducing poverty is to promote self-employment. 
          
          Unfortunately, most people don't understand how I can apply my ICT skills and deal with unemployment. To be a good entrepreneur, you have to be innovative. Innovation is related to ICT. Nowadays, most modern or new enterprises are created based on ICT alone. New telecommunication systems, new software developments, and new technologies make things work faster and better.
          
          In addition to that, it is essential to choose wisely a good source of ICT skills. Since Davis College is an excellent school, I have selected it too. I believe that Davis college provides all essential ICT skills that make one competent in the labor market and equips them with lots of business ideas.  
          
          In conclusion, I wish to grab this opportunity to develop my ICT skills in a competent school where I'll be able to create my job. By being resolute, I will employ people in my community since I will be a good entrepreneur. Thus, poverty eliminated. </p>
